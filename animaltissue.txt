1. Animal_tissue: Nervous tissue, muscular tissue, connective tissue, epithelial tissue
2. Nervous_tissue: control and coordination
3. soma: cellbody in neuron
4. neuroglia: physiological and metabolic support to neuron

5. muscular_tissue: skeletal, cardiac, smooth
6. skeletal: striated, cylindrical, voluntary, multi-nucleated (function:  motion, movement, posture detection)
8. cardiac: cylindrical, heart, branched, striated, uni-nucleated, involuntary (function: pumps blood to all parts of the body)
10. smooth: internal organs, spindle shape, fusi form shape, single centred nucleus, non striated
11. smooth: iris of eye, uterus, gall bladder, walls of hollow internal organs, airways to lungs, stomach intestines, urinary bladder

12. connective_tissue: tendon, ligament, blood, chondrocyte, bone or osteocyte, adipose, areolar
13. tendon: bone to muscle (matrix of bone: calcium, sulphur salt)
14. ligament: bone to bone
15. blood: plasma, rbc, wbc, platelets( 55% contain plasma)
16. rbc: erythrocyte. (carry gases)
17. wbc: leukocyte (defend mechanism)
18. platelets: thrombocyte, blood clotting

19. chondrocyte: cartilage, hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage (function: protects body of injury movements, protective covering for delicate tissues, support bone joints, cushion lubricate flexibility to movements)
20. hyaline_cartilage: tip of nose, rib cage, throat
21. elastic_cartilage: ear

23. adipose_tissue: adipocytes, triglicarate, fats (function: reduces heat loss through skin, energy reserve, support, protects organs)

27. Areloar_tissue: packing material, present around blood vessels, present in nerves, present in body organs(function: strength, elasticity, support)

28. epithelial_tissue: squamous, cuboidal, columnar
29. simple_squamous: alveolar linning, air sacs, blood vessels (helps in diffusion)
30. stratified_squamous: keratinised layers of skins, vagina, lining of the mouth, oesophagus, epiglottis, pharynx, tongue
31. simple_cuboidal: kidney tubular lining
32. stratified_cuboidal: mammary gland, swat gland, salivary gland
33. simple_columnar: lines gastrointestinal tracts, stomach to anus, gallbladder
34. ciliated_columnar: uterine, fallopian tubes, uterus
35. stratified_columnar: male urethra
36. pseudo_stratified_ciliated_columnar: respiratory passage of ducts of many glands
