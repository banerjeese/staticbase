1. plant_tissue: meristematic tissue, permanent tissue, apical, intercalary, lateral
2. meristimatic_tissue: apical, intercalary, lateral
3. apical: primary growth, root apical, shoot apical (present at the tip of plants)
4. intercalary: primary growth, present in between the nodes (helps in growing grass, example is sugarcane)
5. lateral: secondary growth(present in width of the plant)
6. permanent: simple tissue, complex tissue.
7. simple: ground tissue, parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma.

8. parenchyma: storage, living-cell, loosely packed, large intercellular spaces, chlorenchyma, aerenchyma, large vacuoles.
9. chlorenchyma: chloroplasts, photosynthesis
10. aerenchyma: consists of huge air gaps, buoyancy to the plants (found in aquatic plants)
11. collenchyma: flexibility, cell wall- pectin, uneven or irregular thickening- cell wall, large vacuoles.
12. sclerenchyma: strength support, even or regular thickening- cell wall, cell wall - lignin (example is coconut husk)

13. complex_tissue: xylem, phloem
15. xylem: tracheids, vessels, xylem-parenchyma, xylem-fiber (flow- unidirectional transfer of water and mineral)
16. phloem: sieve tubes, companion cell, phloem-parenchyma, phloem-fiber

17. tracheids: dead.
18. vessels: dead.
19. xylem_parenchyma: living.
20. xylem_fiber: dead.
21. phloem_parenchyma: living.
22. phloem-fiber: dead.
23. seivetube_cells: living.
24. companion_cells: living.

25. meristimatic_characteristics: highly active, dense cytoplasm, prominent nucleas, thin cellulosic cell walls, lack vacoules, tiny vacoules.
26. permanent_characteristics: large vacoules, thick walls, dead or living, termination of cell divisions.
